## 🎯 The Problem That Breaks Hearts

**Every single day, 10,000 Americans over 65 pass away**, taking irreplaceable family stories, wisdom, and traditions with them forever. Current memory preservation methods fail catastrophically:

- 📚 **Traditional journals** sit blank and intimidating
- 🎥 **Video recordings** feel formal and awkward  
- 📸 **Photo albums** collect dust in closets
- 💔 **Family history vanishes** without a trace

**The devastating result:** Generations of precious wisdom disappear forever, leaving families disconnected from their heritage.
